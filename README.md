# Covid Cases Dummy API

## How To Build (2 Steps)
 1. We can easily pull the image from the Docker Hub: ``` docker pull fammi/covid-status-api-crow ```
 2. Create the container without specific settings needed:
    ```
    docker container create --name "CONTAINER_NAME" --publish "PORT":18080 fammi/covid-status-api-crow:dummy```

## How To Use
- The API specification is in here: [Covid Cases Dummy API Specification](https://fahmi-g.github.io/Covid-Cases-nodeflux/)

  You can even use that for testing your API that you just built (The Covid Cases Dummy API). How cool!

## API Testing
  <ul><li> If you are a Postman person and more prefer to use Postman, dont worry we got you.
  Here is the link if you want to use our tests collection: [Postman Covid Cases Dummy API Tests Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/a8c4c7c1ec07498ca7ac)</li>
  <ul><li><img src="assets/images/pass.png" alt="Tests" width="500"/></li></ul></ul>

#### How do i use that link?
   <ol><li> Open Postman, in the left hand side you will see the collections tab. Then simply click Import.</li>
   <ul><li><img src="assets/images/pm1.png" alt="Collections Tab" width="400"/></li></ul>
   <li> Go to the link tab, and just paste the provided link there and click Continue.</li>
   <ul><li><img src="assets/images/pm2.png" alt="Link Tab" width="400"/></li></ul>
   <li> And you just have to click Import and you are done.</li>
   <ul><li><img src="assets/images/pm3.png" alt="Import" width="400"/></li></ul></ol>
    -  Now you can use and modify our test collection as you want.

## How The Backend Work
   <ul><li>Here is a simple picture of how the API operates in the backend.</li>

## API Performance
- Here are some picture of API performance/resource usage
  <ul><li>Idle API</li>
   <ul><li><img src="assets/images/before.png" alt="Idle" width="500"/></li></ul></ul>
  <ul><li>With repetitive requests</li>
   <ul><li><img src="assets/images/while.png" alt="Idle" width="500"/></li></ul></ul>
   
- Logs
  <ul><li>Healty logs, no error</li>
   <ul><li><img src="assets/images/logs.png" alt="Idle" width="500"/></li></ul></ul>

## Limitations
1. The API is built without CMAKE which is less efficient. It's because I'm not that familiar with CMAKE, but I will create some programs with CMAKE in the future.
2. The API uses a static mechanism, the data inside is hardcoded so input from users currently doesn't really do much to the response.
3. Since this is just a simple API and not hosted I cannot do many tests such as state correction, latency test, etc.
